[SCENE START]
INT. REPLATE HQ - DAY
The office is bright, vibrant, and filled with a small, focused team. The "KILOS SAVED" monitor on the wall shows a massive, ever-increasing number.

MAYA and LIAM stand side-by-side in the middle of the office. The background buzz softens. They both turn and look directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall. They are smiling, grateful, and confident.

LIAM (To camera) We wanted to thank Auth0 for being there to help this business grow. Without you as a partner, we would have had to allocate so much of our scarce human resources to mundane IT jobs. But instead, we managed to allocate those resources efficiently toward our growth. And that... that totally paid off.

MAYA (To camera, with a sincere smile) I’ll admit, I had big doubts about the viability of Auth0 at the start. It wasn’t the cheapest solution out there, and we were very low on budget. But choosing Auth0 happened to be one of the best decisions we ever made. Auth0 is not a liability. It is an asset that keeps on giving.

LIAM And to you all, the Auth0 engineers... we want to assure you that what you’re doing has so much meaning and impact in the world.

MAYA Keep on innovating. Keep on building. We need you for a safe and better world.

They both hold their sincere smiles to the camera as the scene fades to white.

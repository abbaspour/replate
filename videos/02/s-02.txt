LIAM: All right, check it out.
LIAM: I've got the first version of the website ready to go.
MAYA: Awesome, let's see it.
0:05: It's simple.
LIAM: Think of the website as the donor home base.
LIAM: Here's the login.
LIAM: After authentication, donors land on the dashboard.
LIAM: They can suggest community groups or food suppliers for us to contact, and most importantly, they can support us here through donations.
MAYA: It's clean, but why do we need donors to authenticate?
MAYA: Isn't that a bit too much of a barrier to just suggest a supplier?
LIAM: I thought about this too.
LIAM: The moment I put a test version online without authentication, we started getting loads of spam recommendations.
LIAM: It really slowed down the manual review process.
MAYA: Ah, right, that makes sense.
MAYA: So what are we using for the login?
LIAM: Well, I found this service, Auth0.
LIAM: They seem to have all the features we need for donor login, and it looks like it will scale for a future business side portal.
LIAM: Plus, they have a generous free plan to get us started.
MAYA: Right, but I've heard Auth0A can get pricey and a bit rigid once you're locked in.
MAYA: Have you looked into other options?
LIAM: Yeah, but right now we're experimenting.
LIAM: Speed is what matters.
LIAM: So far the experience has been positive, and they're pretty standard in the industry.
LIAM: We can always switch if we hit a roadblock with them down the line.
MAYA: Sounds great.
MAYA: Let's push ahead.

[SCENE START]
INT. REPLATE HQ - DAY
Several months later. The office is visibly larger, with more desks. Two new team members (the former support staff) are in the background, on the phone, working on a marketing plan. The "KILOS SAVED" monitor shows a much larger number.

MAYA is walking back to her desk, a coffee mug in hand, looking energized.

MAYA The federation rollout was a total success. Moving two more from support to marketing has been like pouring gasoline on the fire. Our outreach to national chains is finally getting traction.

LIAM (Looks up from his desk) It’s been a massive unlock. Our B2B platform feels truly professional now.

MAYA (Her energy dips slightly) It feels professional, but... I just got off a call with Sarah.

LIAM (Leans back, concerned) The last support specialist. Don't tell me...

MAYA She's burning out, Liam. She's brilliant, but she says every new enterprise federation setup is a war. It’s a storm of back-and-forth emails, phone calls, just to get it working.

LIAM What’s the core problem?

MAYA Diversity. Every business has its own identity provider. She said the online ones, like Google Workspaces or Okta, are manageable. But the home-grown ones... she said they're "hairy." Our 'rinse and repeat' documentation is useless for them.

LIAM (Nodding, understanding) So each one is a custom engineering project.

MAYA Worse. It's a key-person dependency. This stuff is deeply technical—SAML, OIDC, metadata... she gets it, but when she took a sick day last week? The entire enterprise onboarding pipeline just... stopped. Dead.

LIAM (Sighs) We freed up four people, only to get bottlenecked by the last one. We need to scale the process, not just the person.

Liam stares at his screen for a moment, thinking.

LIAM Hang on. I think Auth0 might have a solution for this, too. I was just reading their latest newsletter. They mentioned a new feature... "self-service single sign-on."

MAYA Self-service? As in... they do it, not us?

LIAM That's the idea. Instead of Sarah trading technical specs over email, the customer's IT admin gets a simple portal. They log in, choose their provider, upload their own files, test the connection, and enable it themselves. It could completely offload the technical setup to the business customer.

MAYA (A slow smile spreads across her face) That... would be the final piece. We could finally move Sarah to marketing and have our entire support model automated.
She looks at Liam, her confidence returning.

MAYA It's worth giving it a shot. So far, Auth0 has fulfilled all our consumer and business growth needs. Honestly, I’ll be surprised if they haven't already solved this problem for us.

LIAM (Already typing) I'm looking into the docs now.

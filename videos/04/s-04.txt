[SCENE START]
INT. SMALL PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT
Weeks later. MAYA and LIAM are in a small, glass-walled office, an upgrade from their co-working desk. A large whiteboard behind them is covered in flowcharts and names. It's late. Maya rubs her temples, looking tired but proud.

MAYA Fifty. Fifty venues, Liam. And over ten community centres now. Not to mention the three logistics partners... my phone has not stopped.

LIAM (Looking up from his own screen) It's incredible. The model is working.

MAYA It's working too well. I was on the phone until 10 PM coordinating pickups. My master spreadsheet is... it's a monster. We can't keep assigning drivers to venues manually. It's not scalable. We need to build the business platform, now.

Liam nods, closing his laptop. He swivels his chair to face her, ready for this.

LIAM I agree. We're at our limit. It’s time. We can follow the same pattern as the donor site: build a central Business API. That one API can then power both a new web app for the suppliers and community managers, and, down the line, a mobile app for the drivers themselves.

MAYA A B2B platform. Okay. But this is way more complex than donors. We're managing whole organizations—venues, charities, logistics companies, all with their own staff and drivers. Can Auth0 even model that?

LIAM It should. I've been looking into it. They've clearly thought about B2B SaaS requirements. We can set up each venue and logistics partner as an 'organization' within Auth0, and then manage their individual staff or drivers as members. It's built to handle those complex roles and permissions.

MAYA So we don't have to build that user management system from scratch?

LIAM Exactly. We start by building the business website with Auth0 handling the B2B side. We get feedback from our partners. If the feedback is good, we use that same API to build the native app.

MAYA (A small, determined smile appears) Okay. Let's build the platform.

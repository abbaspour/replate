[SCENE START]
LIAM: Alex's party was incredible, a 10 out of 10.
MAYA: The food was amazing. Those little mushroom tarts were divine.
LIAM: But did you see the cleanup?
MAYA: Yeah, trays of untouched food, dumped. I saw at least 3 full trays of those tarts go straight into the garbage.
MAYA: Venues must do this every single night.
MAYA: Weddings, corporate events, a massive constant waste.
MAYA: What if we could connect that food to people who need it?
LIAM: Connecting venues with food banks, like through an app?
MAYA: An app is too big to start. We start small.
LIAM: A website.
LIAM: I can build a simple landing page this week.
LIAM: We tell the story.
LIAM: We call it The Food Connect project.
MAYA: People sign up.
MAYA: They suggest venues we can approach.
MAYA: We build a community,
LIAM: we show the venues that people want this to happen. We start a tiny ripple.
MAYA: We can do this.
LIAM: Let's get started.

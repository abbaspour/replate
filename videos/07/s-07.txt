[SCENE START]
INT. REPLATE HQ - NIGHT

It’s late. The main office is dark, but LIAM and MAYA are in a glass-walled meeting room, illuminated by the glow of a large monitor. The monitor shows a world map, with glowing data points across Europe, North America, and a new, active cluster in the Middle East.

MAYA (Sighs, rubbing her eyes) It’s incredible, seeing the data from the new region. I’m so proud we managed to launch the Right-to-Left version of the site so quickly. The aid groups on the ground say it’s making a real difference.

LIAM Auth0's localization features were a lifesaver. Adapting the login and sign-up flows was fast, right when it was needed. But... this new visibility is a double-edged sword.

Maya’s expression darkens. She nods.

MAYA You're telling me. I got another one this morning. An email. "Send five bitcoin, or we will bring Replate down." Our international growth has put a massive target on our back.

LIAM (Grave, nodding) Going overseas hasn't been the smoothest ride. I'm watching the security logs. Auth0's bot detection and brute-force protection are catching thousands of attempts a day. But they can't cover the whole attack surface.

MAYA What aren't they catching?

LIAM It's a different kind of attack. They're not just trying to guess passwords. They're generating massive waves of fake traffic from specific IP ranges. They consume all our login rate limits, which means civilians and legitimate business users... they can't log in. It's a Denial of Service attack, aimed right at our front door.

MAYA (Leaning forward) So what do we do? I just had a call with that traffic analytics startup'. They say that based on traffic patterns, they can detect with high confidence if a visitor is a legitimate user or part of a DoS swarm.

LIAM Exactly. We need a way to bring that insight into Auth0. To act on that data. I saw Auth0 just announced a new feature: a Tenant Access Control List, or ACL. I assume it does exactly that—it lets us proactively block entire IP ranges before they can consume any resources.

Maya looks at the glowing map, at the cluster of data representing people in crisis. She exhales slowly.

MAYA We just need to keep these hackers away. Keep them from bringing this business down to its knees, especially now.

LIAM (His face set with determination) We will. We can feed traffic insight data right into the ACL. Auth0 is on our side. Don't worry.
